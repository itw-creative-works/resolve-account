Install with CDN if you plan to use Resolve Account only in a browser environment.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/resolve-account@latest/dist/index.min.js"></script>

  var resolved = new ResolveAccount().resolve({
    // ... pass in the account JSON from Firebase Firestore
  })
</script>
```
